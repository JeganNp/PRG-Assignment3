    Description:
    This program is a text-based mining and exploration game where the player must
    earn at least 500 GP to win. The player explores a mine, collects minerals, sells them,
    and can purchase upgrades (backpack, pickaxe, torch). The game includes saving/loading,
    a fog-of-war map system, portals, and a top score leaderboard.'''

''' - Reads the cave layout from Level1.txt
    - Saves/loads game state from saved_game.json
    - Stores top scores in top_scores.json
